## Architecture

### AWS Hub-Spoke Topology
```
Internet → IGW → NAT Gateway (Hub DMZ) → Transit Gateway → Spokes (Prod/Dev/Security)
                                              ↓
                                         VPN Gateway → Azure
```

### Azure Hub-Spoke Topology
```
Internet → Azure Firewall (Hub) → VNet Peering → Spokes (Prod/Dev/Security)
                 ↓
           VPN Gateway → AWS
```

### Network Design Highlights

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with IAM permissions for VPC, EC2, VPN
- Azure Subscription with Contributor role
- Terraform >= 1.9.0
- AWS CLI v2
- Azure CLI

### 1. Review Documentation

```bash
# Read architecture design
cat docs/architecture/network-design.md

# Review CIDR allocation (no overlaps!)
cat docs/architecture/cidr-allocation.md

# Understand security controls
cat docs/security/controls-matrix.md
```

### 2. View Network Diagrams

Diagrams are in Mermaid format and render automatically on GitHub. To view locally:

```bash
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
mmdc -i diag/aws-topology.mmd -o diag/aws-topology.png
```

### 3. Deploy Infrastructure (Future - Phase 2)

```bash
# Deploy AWS hub-spoke
cd modules/aws
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file=prod.tfvars
terraform apply

# Deploy Azure hub-spoke
cd ../azure
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## Security Controls

### Threat Model (STRIDE)

17 threats identified and mitigated:
- **Spoofing**: VPN IP spoofing, bastion impersonation, IAM credential leaks
- **Tampering**: VPN MITM, config drift, route table manipulation
- **Repudiation**: Audit log deletion, VPN change denial
- **Information Disclosure**: VPN PSK exposure, unencrypted data
- **Denial of Service**: NAT exhaustion, VPN saturation, API abuse
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Container escape, IAM role chaining, SG bypass

**Mitigation Status**: 11 implemented, 5 in progress, 1 planned

### CIS Compliance

| Benchmark | Coverage | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| CIS AWS Foundations v1.5 | 83% (53/64) | ✅ Implemented |
| CIS Azure Foundations v2.0 | 85% | ✅ Implemented |
| NIST CSF 2.0 | 81% (39/48) | ✅ Implemented |

### Encryption Standards

| Layer | Protocol | Cipher | Key Management |
|-------|----------|--------|----------------|
| VPN Tunnel | IPsec IKEv2 | AES-256-GCM, DH Group 14 | Secrets Manager/Key Vault |
| HTTPS (ALB) | TLS 1.2+ | ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 | AWS ACM |
| Data at Rest | - | AES-256 | KMS CMK (AWS), Key Vault (Azure) |
| Database | TLS 1.2 | AES256-SHA256 | RDS/Azure SQL enforced |

## Incident Response

**Workflow**: Detect → Contain → Remediate → Report

**Detection Sources**:
- AWS GuardDuty (cryptocurrency mining, SSH brute force, C&C activity)
- Azure Defender for Cloud (malware, anomalous access)
- CloudWatch/Azure Monitor (CIS metric filters for 14 security events)
- VPC Flow Logs (unusual data transfer patterns)

**Auto-Remediation Examples**:
- SSH brute force → Block source IP via NACL
- Cryptocurrency mining → Isolate instance, create forensic snapshot
- Unauthorized API call → Revoke IAM session
- Public S3 bucket → Remove public ACL

**KPIs**:
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD): <10 minutes
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR): <30 minutes
- Mean Time to Resolve: <4 hours

## Cost Management

### Tagging Strategy

5 mandatory tags for all resources:
- `Environment` (prod/dev/staging/sandbox)
- `Owner` (email/team)
- `CostCenter` (ENG-001, SEC-001, etc.)
- `ManagedBy` (Terraform/Manual)
- `DataClassification` (public/internal/confidential/restricted)

**Cost Allocation**: Monthly chargeback reports by CostCenter with shared cost allocation (NAT gateway, VPN, GuardDuty)

**Auto-Shutdown**: Dev/sandbox instances automatically stopped nightly (~70% cost reduction)

## Tech Stack

**Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform (primary), CloudFormation/Bicep (reference)
**Cloud Providers**: AWS, Azure
**Security**: GuardDuty, Azure Defender, CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, KMS, Key Vault
**Monitoring**: CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, SNS, PagerDuty
**CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with OIDC (no static credentials)
**Networking**: Transit Gateway, VNet Peering, VPN Gateway, NAT Gateway, Azure Firewall

## Design Principles

1. **Security by Default**: Encryption at rest/transit, least privilege IAM, deny-by-default firewall rules
2. **Infrastructure as Code**: All resources managed via Terraform, no manual changes
3. **Cost Optimization**: Centralized egress, auto-shutdown dev resources, right-sized instances
4. **High Availability**: Multi-AZ design, redundant NAT gateways, active-active VPN
5. **Compliance**: CIS benchmarks, NIST CSF 2.0, audit logging with immutable storage
6. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, security monitoring, incident response automation
